the testing of the models is doen in result file if you want to test the models locally

the preprocesing with lower string,stop word removal and lemmatization is done in Link file
first overall state of data is evaluated and then the preprocessing is done

in Untitled grid search was performed and with those results the models were created

Svm outperformed Random forest in almost all metrics  as accuracy and recall
Lematization affected performance only slightly but cost a lot in pre processing time

the class from which i loaded data to untitled was to large so only the models are uploaded

***********
The state of notebook shows the results of latest runs not previous results upon which some of the decision were based
